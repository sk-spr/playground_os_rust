# playground_os_rust
A simple OS project, written in Rust. Planned to be a macos system 1 clone with a modern kernel underneath.

## Desktop
The desktop environment for this kernel, Modesto, is currently in the early prototype stage. You can find the project (and excuse the horrible inefficiencies for now) on my github at sk-spr/modesto_desktop_proto

## Beginner warning
This is my third or so run at building a kernel, but it is my first time doing it in rust. I have never gotten particularly far but I am planning to get it as far as possible. If you are interested in contributing, take a look at the TODO, or if you have a feature request you could possibly implement, contact me at skye.sprung@gmail.com

## How to run
```
cd playground_os_rust
cargo run
```
